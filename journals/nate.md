<!-- Each day that you work on the project, you must make an entry in your journal after you've finished that day. At a minimum, you will need to include the following information:

    - The date of the entry
    - A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable
    - A reflection on any design conversations that you had
    - At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small
    -
Keep your journal in reverse chronological order. Always put new entries at the top. -->

Today I worked on Frontend edit and delete. I also worked with Andrew on campaign details.

I created edit and delete buttons to conditionally appear for campaign list if the user created that campaign. The delete button deletes the campaign and re-renders the page, Edit makes a PUT. We also worked on deployment. I helped Brian on the README. Created mock data for the presentation
