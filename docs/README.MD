## Users microservice

**User model**<br />
This model represents a user of the project. It tracks their user id number, email, and password.<br />


## Campaigns microservice

**Campaign model**<br />
This model represents a larp. It tracks the larp's id number, title, genre, detail, a url for the rulebook, an email for the gamemaster, and the user id number of the gamemaster.<br />

**Event model**<br />
This model represents an event of a larp. Larp campaigns are composed of their events. The model tracks the event's id number, name, venue, address, date, and the associated larp's campaign id number.<br />

**Participant model**<br />
This model represents a user's character at the larp. Participants can sign up for events. The model tracks their participant id number, the user's id number, their character's name, the id number of the campaign, and the event id of the event they are registered to attend (if any).<br />
